### My Answer

```python
import heapq

def solution(n, paths, gates, summits):
    G = {i:[] for i in range(1,n+1)} # G[i] is list of [cost,node]
    gates = set(gates)
    summits = set(summits)
    for i,j,w in paths : 
        if i not in summits and j not in gates  : 
            G[i].append([w,j])
        if j not in summits and i not in gates : 
            G[j].append([w,i])
        
    res = 0
    visit = set()
    distance = {i:float('inf') for i in range(1,n+1)}
    heap = [] # cost, point
    for x in gates : 
        distance[x]=0
        heapq.heappush(heap,[0,x])
        
    while heap : 
        cost, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        #print("node :", node,"cost :",cost)
        if node in visit : continue
        visit.add(node)
        #if len(visit)==n : return [node,cost]
        for cost2, near in G[node] : 
            if near in visit : continue
            if distance[near] > max(cost,cost2) : 
                distance[near] = max(cost,cost2)
                heapq.heappush(heap,[distance[near], near])
    
    res = [[distance[x], x] for x in summits]
    res.sort()
    #print(res)
    return res[0][::-1]
```
